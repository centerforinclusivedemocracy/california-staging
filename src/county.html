                <p>Sites are colored based on their relative rank out of all potential sites within a county and are classified into quantiles. The individual components of the composite score are displayed in the legend as being either <b>High</b>, <b>Med</b> or <b>Low</b>. The <b>High/Med/Low</b> are based on the distribution of scores for each component and ranked using quantile classification.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Suggested Sites</b>: Sites that have been identified as being strategically located to voters. This reflects the minimum number of sites required. </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Additional Suggested Sites</b>:  Sites that are suggested if additional sites over the required minimum are desired. These sites assume the existence of the <b>Suggested Sites</b>.
                        <ul>
                            <li><i>Based on Model</i>: Additional 10% of sites that were generated from the Facility Location Model which minimize the total travel cost for all people in the county.</li>
                            <li><i>Based on Distance</i>: Additional sites that were identified based on their potential to decrease travel times for communities that have travel times over ~15 minutes to their nearest site.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>All Suitable Sites</b>:  All suitable sites are all sites that had a minimum of population, built environment, roads, etc. where a vote site could potentially be located. These sites can be used to identify nearby sites with similar scores if the suggested site does not contain an actual reasonable voting location. </li>
