        </p>

        <h2 id="data">Data Updates</h2>
          <p>
            The following Siting Tool data sources have been updated:
            <ul>
              <li>OpenStreetMap Points of Interest, as of June 1, 2021</li>
              <li>GTFS Transit Data, as of June 1, 2021</li>
              <li>American Community Survey 5-Year Estimate (2015-2019)</li>
              <li>UCB Statewide Database Registration and Voter Data (2020 General Election)</li>
            </ul>

            The following Siting Tool data sources have been added:
            <ul>
              <li>2020 General Election Voting Locations</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <h2 id="design">Map Design Updates</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Legend Color Breaks: </b>Previously, the color breaks used in the map legend for the Site Scores, Demographic and Voter Data, and Population Data were created using Jenks Natural Breaks. In this update, we've updated the map legend color breaks to use quantile classification so that values are ranked and divided equally into five classes where possible. In smaller counties with insufficient data, raw values are used rather than quantile classification.</li>
          <li><b>All Potential Areas: </b>All potential sites were previously located under the Suggested Voting Location Areas section of the sidebar and can now instead be found in it's own section.</li>
          <li><b>Info Buttons: </b>We added info buttons to different areas of the map to provide users with additional information where needed.</li>
          <li><b>Points of Interest: </b>We updated the colors used to indicate different points of interest to more clearly differentiate each category.</li>
