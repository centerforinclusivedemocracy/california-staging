                Developed by the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) at the University of Southern California, this interactive web-based mapping tool is designed to assist California elections officials in the state’s 58 counties.

            CID has updated the Voting Location Siting Tool for the gubernatorial recall election, except for Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. Voting location modeling for these three counties will be available soon.

            <h1>About This Tool</h1>

            <p>
                The Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by identifying optimal voting locations and ballot drop boxes for half-mile grid squares across a county. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level.

                <!-- Currently, the Voting Location Siting Tool provides location modeling for vote centers (4 day and 11 day) and drop boxes for 14 of the 15 counties that have adopted the California Voter’s Choice Act (Butte is omitted). Additionally, the Tool now provides modeling for voting locations (4 day) and drop boxes for the rest of California’s counties (except the all vote-by-mail counties of Alpine, Plumas, and Sierra) consistent with the siting options available to counties through <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB423__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!-8qD99XrAssswncBjIXqt0fZFSii4oKvMjgeDhbAeENxhAYqvcH114AKHWn80O4$">California Senate Bill 423</a>.  -->

We note here that some California counties may choose to conduct the recall election under a traditional polling place model.

            <p>
                The Tool visualizes multiple types of community-level demographic and voter data for Alpine, Butte, Plumas, and Sierra counties  as separate interactive maps.

            <p>
                Note: The Tool sites the legally required number of voting locations in a county as a minimum baseline. The Siting Tool’s purpose is to model the location of voting sites, not to suggest what number of voting locations best serves a community.

            <h1>What is the Voter's Choice Act?</h1>

            <p>
                In 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 450, known as the Voter's Choice Act (VCA), which allows counties to choose to adopt a new voting system. In counties choosing to adopt the new model, every registered voter is mailed a Vote-by-Mail (VBM) ballot, which voters can either mail in, or return at a ballot drop box or a newly established vote center. At vote centers, which replace traditional neighborhood polling places, voters can cast their ballots in person, drop off their completed VBM ballots, access conditional voter registration, receive replacement ballots, and access additional resources, such as language assistance and accessible voting machines. There are fewer vote centers than polling places by design and vote centers are open to voters for up to ten days prior to Election Day and available for all voters to utilize countywide. Voters can choose to cast their vote through the mail or at a drop box, and those desiring an in-person experience (e.g., using an accessible voting system, location convenience or for a sense of community) would have numerous days to do so rather than just one. Five of California’s 58 counties adopted the model for the 2018 election cycle—Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento and San Mateo. The following counties adopted the VCA for the 2020 election cycle: Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Fresno, Los Angeles (LA county chose to not mail all registered voters VBM ballots in the 2020 primary), Mariposa, Orange, Santa Clara and Tuolumne. In total, fifteen California counties are conducting elections under the Voter’s Choice Act in 2020—approximately half the state’s current registered voter population.
